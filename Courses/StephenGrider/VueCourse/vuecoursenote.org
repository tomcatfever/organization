In Vue, Templates and Instances are one way of structuring an app.
+ *Vue Templates* are /created in HTML/ and /describes the structure and content of the app/.  
  + /It is possible to make Vue TemplatTes in JavaScript as well./
+ *Vue Instances* are /created in JavaScript/ and /describes what happens when a user interacts with the app/.

A Vue Instance can access a Template using built-in document object model query selector methods.

#+BEGIN_SRC js
// Selects the element with a id of app
new Vue({
  el: '#app'
});
#+END_SRC

To better illustrate these principals, we will build an app.
