** /Review/
Documentation written by the creator of OrgMode Carsten Dominik. Well written,
the guide describes 'major mode' functions along with potential OrgMode front
matter options for global and document based configurations.
** /Take-away Thoughts/ 
+ It seems best to use front matter files for customization and configurations.
+ OrgMode is a good way to track time and effort in a specific project.
+ Spacemacs has some key binding differences.
  + Examples:
  /S+right-arrow/ toggles TODO state
  /TAB/ & /S+TAB/ expand & collapse subtree

** /Review/
A deep dive into different OrgMode functions. He is assumes the viewer 
understands the different emacs key-bindings. Useful for learning advanced
features.  Not great for learning with Spacemacs or Evil-mode.
