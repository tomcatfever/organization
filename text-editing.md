<title>Text Editing</title>  

*Everything they didn't teach you about writing in English class.*

Writing and editing text is the most common uses for a computer user.

Everyone everyone needs it.

Students, teachers, professionals, small business owners, organizations, teams, parents, friends... humans use words to communicate.

Those words often need to be written down.

And, using a software tool like Microsoft Word or Google Docs is much easier than using a typewriter or a pen and paper.

But, it doesn't matter what lifestyle blog you've read.  If you have used a mechanical typewriter, you know fiddling with a word processor is **WAY** better than the alternative.

The mechanical typewriter alternative is includes keeping track of all your margins and line spacing as you type.

And don't start on key jams and ribbon replacements.  If you think printer jams and ink carterage replacements are difficult, imagine having unjam the hammers on a piano whenever you hit the wrong combination of notes.  Or having to replace a ribbon *that was dipped in ink*.

Messy.  That is reality of yesterday.

On the other hand, word processessors Microsoft Word, Apple Pages, LibreOffice, and Google Docs are amazing for a narrow set of uses.

MS Word is great is typing up a 5 paragraph essay.  Even a 5 to 10 page document.  It is a standard for interoffice communications, proposals, and even legal paperwork.

But, have ever had to type a 30+ page paper? Or needed to insert charts?  Or had to use special symbols like legal trademarks or mathmatics notation?

Rich text formatting editors like MS Word fall short very quickly as those pages and special needs come up.

One solution to long documents is typing in multiple Word files. But, that falls short quickly when you need to compile those documents into a final result. 

A solution to special characters is writing custom macros.  But, that requires painstakingly typesetting and encoding characters into inflexable blocks.

Those approaches are not great if you are writing a book, a long form article, academic journal, or legal brief.

And if you are writing for the web?  Forget it, the web is written in HTML not Rich Text.

Ever painstakingly format a handout only to find that it looks like garbage in the exported HTML and PDF?

Are you wealthy enough to write a blogpost on a legal pad and have it delivered to your staff programmer?

If you are considering a journalism, copyediting, book writing, or blogging project... clearly there is a missing skillset.

Enter plain text editors.

Windows has Notepad.  Mac has TextEdit.  Everything else has Vi.  Never heard of Vi?  Prepare your body for the rabbit hole.

Notepad and TextEdit are plain text editors which support a graphical user interface.  Both respond to commands from the keyboard and a mouse.

Vi and Vi iMporved (ViM) are shell or terminal based text editors.  These only work in your computer's command line.  And only support commands from the keyboard.

Any and all of these are great for quickly editing some file.  Not immediately useful for larger, more complex project.

And while ViM is very customizable, it has an extremely difficult learning curve.

Enter integrated development environments and extendable text editors. 

These include proprietary / freemium ones like Eclipse, Visual Studio, and Sublime Text.  And open source ones like Atom, VS Code, and the venerable GNU Emacs.  Finally, are also advanced tools like OmniWriter and Scrivener which use their own specialized approach.

Any of will solve all your tactical problems related to writing stuff.  It will cost you a steep learning curve.

But, the reward is an ability to publish and share your thoughts with a wider audience.

So how do you choose?

I have tried everything.  I'm talking about hours of my free time spent looking a **AMAZING NEW TOOLS** and **MASTERING THE CLASSICS** and **HACKING YOUR WORKFLOW**.
